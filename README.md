### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
##### Welcome to my Github Account
I'm Herbert and I working as a Front end Developer for 7 years and counting. I love coding, anything around tech and photogprahy. I'm currently improving my skills and learning on react and react native which as a web developer and front end developer it is a great tool to add on my skillset for mobile and front end development.

In this account I will be adding my collection of resources that I have learned of the past years and also my coding exercises that I have worked on. Please feel free to roam around the repositories incase you found it usefull.
